        <h1>Features for Students</h1>
        <p>Our state-of-the-art system empowers students with a seamless process for marking attendance, harnessing the latest advancements in facial recognition and QR code technology. This dual-modality approach ensures that students have access to a convenient and flexible attendance experience that fits a variety of classroom settings.

        Privacy is paramount, and we ensure that all data is encrypted and stored securely, complying with the highest standards of data protection. Our commitment to privacy means that students can trust in the confidentiality and security of their personal information at all times.
